## Survey App
This is a backend application implemented with `Express.js and GraphQL API routes` where users can authenticate themselves with JSON Web Tokens, create surveys and let other users attempt their survey questions. 

### Understanding API routes and DB
- Under `public_resources/` directory you have the DB design of the app and a Postman collection file available that you can import in your Postman app to hit the GraphQL API endpoints.
